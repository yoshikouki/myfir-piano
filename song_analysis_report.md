--- Song: zou_san (ぞうさん) ---

  Length Criteria: PASS
  Melodic Analysis:
    Pitch Range: C4 (0) to D5 (14)
    Unique Pitches: A4, C4, C5, D4, D5, F4, G4
    Melodic Issues:
      - Potential out-of-key notes (assuming C major/relative scale): None (all fit C major or F major context - song is often in F)
      - Large interval: A4 to D5 (5 semitones, not >12, this is fine)
      - Large interval: A4 to D5 (again, fine)
      - Note: The song is often considered in F major. If F major is assumed (F,G,A,Bb,C,D,E), then all notes {C4,D4,F4,G4,A4,C5,D5} are diatonic.
  Rhythmic Analysis:
    BPM: 90, Time Signature: [3, 4]
    Rhythmic Issues:
      - Total song duration (60.0) aligns with measure length (3). (No issue, this is good)

--- Summary of Songs with Potential Issues ---
- do_re_mi (Rhythmic: Total duration/last phrase alignment)
- happy_birthday (Melodic: Bb4 if strictly Cmaj assumed, but fine in Fmaj)
- sakura (Melodic: F#4 if strictly Cmaj assumed, but fine in context of its scale)

Note on "Out-of-key" analysis: The default assumption was C major. Songs like "happy_birthday" (F major) and "sakura" (Japanese scale / E minor variant) have notes that are "out-of-key" for C major but are correct for their actual tonalities. The report reflects this.
Note on "Phrase Alignment": The check for total song duration aligning with the measure signature is a basic heuristic. More nuanced phrase analysis was not performed. "do_re_mi" is the only one flagged by this simple check.
No songs had intervals > 1 octave or successive large leaps in the same direction.
No songs had durations < 0.5 or unusually long durations beyond the examples discussed.
All songs meet the basic length criteria.
